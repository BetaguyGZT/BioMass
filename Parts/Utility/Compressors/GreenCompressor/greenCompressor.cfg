    description = Uses a patented process to convert BioMass into Kethane Gas. Once you have Kethane Gas, you can refine it into Kethane. You need to *store* these Kethane products in tanks on your Station. The Red Compressor will allow you to convert Kethane into Liquid Fuel. Yes, *that* Liquid Fuel. You're welcome!

	MODULE //We get can Ethanol in liquid form from CO2 using the new Copper-based method discovered recently ... since it's beyond KSP to do it properly (Ethanol->Ethene->Methane), we'll fudge it at a 50% penalty and 5x the overhead. That's roughly what it takes *anyway* by the time the process is finished. It's not "60% efficient", more like 6% in real-world efficiency.

    title =  Compressor: Oxidizer
    manufacturer = DuctTape Aerospace Renewables
    description = This Compressor converts CO2, Oxygen and Water into the super-chilled form of Oxidizer used as the fuel catalyst in Rocket Engines. Because the equipment needs to be tailored specifically for this task, it could not be combined with the Grey Compressor. Avoid touching it, as anything that comes into contact with LOX *will* have a tendency to shatter ... and disintegrate ... and become extremely flammable!

	manufacturer = DuctTape Aerospace Renewables
	description = After the wild success of the BioMass greenhouse, the management at DG Aero-Space Renewables said, "Can we have one in green? And heavier?" And thus the aquatic greenhouse was born. Cultivates photosynthetic and other complex organisms in a self contained aquatic environment. When filled with water and provided with proper nutrients and sunlight it can be used to produce BioMass, Nutrients, Oxygen, or just to filter the air and provide a relaxing vista for weary Kerbal Space Travelers. Did we mention it's green? It's heavy ... *seriously* heavy ... oh, and the critters won't take kindly to attempts at swimming in their habitat so we've sealed it up.
